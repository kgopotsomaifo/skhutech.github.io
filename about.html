      <p>
        My name is Sikhumbuzo Ndebele [born. Kgopotso Maifo] and I'm an aspiring
        full stack web developer.I'm passionate about sports, technology and
        finance/economics. Back in my time, I used to play first team rugby. My
        interest in technology is actually derived from my first love which is
        economics. Technology is disrupting all fields and economics is the
        same. Basic supply and demand at play here in the 21st Century. Whoever
        has the capacity to harness the ever changing field of tech will have a
        prosperous future.
